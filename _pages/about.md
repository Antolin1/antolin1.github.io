I’m a predoctoral researcher at Universidad de Murcia under the supervision of [Jesús Sánchez Cuadrado](http://sanchezcuadrado.es/). Basically, I research about topics realted to Machine Learning for Software Engineering. I am also interested in deep learning, natural language processing and recommender systems.

Regarding my hobbies, I am in love with anime and manga (in fact, you can check [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Antolin)). I also like to squat, bench press, and DL to keep fit.
